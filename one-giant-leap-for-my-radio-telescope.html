        <h2>Goal with this Project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I started this project of building a radio telescope for a few reasons. The <i>main</i> motive behind it was that, with a regular telescope, you can see a vast number of things—stars, planets, asteroids, you name it—and it’s wonderful. With the telescope I use, you can connect a digital camera to it and take photographs of anything you see. But then I began to think and realized how much I actually <strong>can’t</strong> see. Think about it—astronomers don’t use visible light to detect most objects. They use radio telescopes because radio waves have a longer wavelength, allowing them to penetrate dense regions of gas and dust that block visible light. Radio telescopes make seeing the invisible possible, and I want to see the cosmos for all its glory.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The First Steps</h2>
        <br>
        <p>How do you build a radio telescope in the first place? There are many ways to go about it, but for a smaller-scale one, you need a satellite dish like the ones you see on the roof of a building. For the one I am going to make, I am planning on making a stand for it that will allow the dish to rotate. That’s not the hard part, though; the hard part is creating the electronics that will allow the dish to move through the use of software. I’ll need some motors, circuit boards, gears, and many more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, the software isn’t the hard part—it’s the hardware. I have never built anything electronic in my life except for a personal computer, which is not that big of a beast to take down, so I’m starting from the ground up. I bought a starter kit that includes a basic circuit board and many electronic components, so I can mess around and experiment by creating a vast number of things. The video below shows the first thing I have ever built with electronics: a light controlled by the push of a button. It’s not that big of a deal for some people, but for me, it was a huge turning point.</p>

        <h2>The Long Road Ahead</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This really is a small step on a road longer than I’ve ever been on before. I won’t have this radio telescope done anytime soon, but I will focus most of my time and effort on it. I want to be able to see beyond what my eyes tell me is out there. I hope to have it done by the third quarter of my junior year, but hey, I have no idea what I’m in for. I just see the end goal and have decided to begin my odyssey. I guarantee that this won’t be easy, but if anything, that’s the fun part. I can’t wait to look back on this blog post in around a year and see how far I’ve come—from just one simple circuit to a full-blown radio astronomy observatory. So here’s to the journey ahead—one circuit, one challenge, and one discovery at a time.</p>
